## Why R for spatial data?

- Extensive and rapidly expanding spatial packages
- Interface with 'conventional' GIS software
- The advantages of the command-line:

> "With the advent of “modern” GIS software, most people want 
> to point and click their way through life.
> That’s good, but there is a tremendous amount of 
> flexibility and power waiting for you with the command
> line. Many times you can do something on the command
> line in a fraction of the time you can do it with
> a GUI (Sherman 2008, p. 283)

## Visualisation

- R's visualisation capabilities have evolved over time
- Used to create plots in the best academic journals
- ggplot2 has **revolutionised** the visualisation of quantitative 
information in R, and (possibly) overall
- Thus there are different camps with different preferences when it comes to maps in R

## Why focus on visualisation?

If you cannot visualise your data, it is very difficult to understand your data. 
Conversely, visualisation will greatly aid in communicating your results.

> Human beings are remarkably adept at discerning relationships from visual
> representations. A well-crafted graph can help you make meaningful comparisons among thousands of pieces of information, extracting patterns not easily found through other methods. ... Data analysts need to look at their data, and this is one area where R shines.
(Kabacoff, 2009, p. 45).

## Maps, the 'base graphics' way

## The 'ggplot2' way of doing things

<!-- ![ggplot2 way](figure/faceteg.png) -->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/faceteg.png")
```

## Course plan

**13:30 - 14:00**: Introduction and downloading the data 

**14:00 - 15:00**: Base graphics and ggplot2

> - 14:00 - 14:30 Loading and exploring the data, base graphics
> - 14:30 - 15:00 ggplot2 (bonus: spatial data classes)
> - 15:00 - 15:30 `**Coffee break**` and discussion/questions

**15:30 - 17:00**: tmap and interactive maps

> - 15:30 - 16:00 tmap
> - 16:00 - 16:30 leaflet and mapview
> - 16:30 - 17:00 leaflet/shiny

## Modus operandi

- Work from the printed tutorial - don't copy and paste!
- Don't just enter the code, run it then move on.
- Play with it, break it, explore it.
- I will interject at intervals with demos/advice
- It will be an iterative process - don't worry too much about timings

```{r}
# Make lots of comments!
```

## Prerequisites

- R
- RStudio
- For some function: R packages (internet needed)


## R Packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggmap", "jsonlite")
install.packages(x)
lapply(x, library, character.only = TRUE) # load all packages
```

## A bit about R

- Named after S and its creators
- De-facto standard for advanced statistical analysis
- A programming language in its own right
- The power of the command line
- Used by an increasing number of organisations

## Why R?

- **Performace**: stable, light and fast
- **Support network** 
 - documentation, community, developers
- **Reproducibility**
 - anyone anywhere can reproduce results
 - enables dissemination (RPubs, RMarkdown, .RPres) - this presentation is a .Rmd file!
- **Versatility**: unified solution to *almost* any numerical problem, graphical capabilities
- **Ethics** removes economic barrier to statistics, is open and democratic

## R is up and coming I

## Why R for spatial data?

- Extensive and rapidly expanding spatial packages
- Interface with 'conventional' GIS software
- The advantages of the command-line:

> "With the advent of “modern” GIS software, most people want 
> to point and click their way through life.
> That’s good, but there is a tremendous amount of 
> flexibility and power waiting for you with the command
> line. Many times you can do something on the command
> line in a fraction of the time you can do it with
> a GUI (Sherman 2008, p. 283)

## Visualisation

- R's visualisation capabilities have evolved over time
- Used to create plots in the best academic journals
- ggplot2 has **revolutionised** the visualisation of quantitative 
information in R, and (possibly) overall
- Thus there are different camps with different preferences when it comes to maps in R

## Maps, the 'base graphics' way

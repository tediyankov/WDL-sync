## Description

R is one of the fastest growing languages for data analysis and is increasingly
important in business, government and academia. Less well-known is that R has
a diverse suite of geospatial tools and can function as a fully integrated
Geographical Information System (GIS). Time-series maps, geographically
weighted regression, animations and even online maps become possible when
you understand R's unique language and approach to spatial objects.

However, as with any language, it is important to gain a strong understanding
of the underlying syntax and structure before moving on to complex uses. 
This course therefore focuses on the foundations: how R can be used to load,
manipulate, process, transform and visualise spatial data.
Prior experience with R is not essential but is recommended;
participants will also benefit from experience with GIS.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Attendees with a clearly
# defined problem that R's spatial capabilities can solve will find the course
# especially beneficial due to its applied and pragmatic nature.
```

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

- Understand the structure of spatial data in R
- Be able to query, subset and analyse spatial objects
- Have a working knowledge of fundamental GIS functions such as changing projections
- Be proficient in the use of R to create maps using add-on packages such as tmap

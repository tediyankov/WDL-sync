# Background

## Why **stplanr**

- Contracted to create the **Propensity to Cycle Tool** (PCT)
- Best way to understand **stplanr** is via a live demo, at **[www.pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)**
- Needed functions to work with origin-destination data and routing services

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/npct/pct/raw/master/flow-model/od-data-leeds.png")
```

## From a transport planner's perspective

Common computational tasks in transportation planning:

- Access to and processing of data on transport infrastructure and behaviour
- Analysis and visualisation of origin-destination flow data
- Allocation of flows to the transport (road) network
- Development of models to estimate transport behaviour
- The calculation of 'catchment areas' affected by transport infrastructure

## Transparency in transport planning 

Transport planning is notoriously reliant on 'black boxes' and
the same applies to scientific research into transport systems
[@Waddell2002].

**stplanr** seeks to address these issues. 

# Using stplanr

## Installing and loading stplanr

**stplanr** lives here: https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr

Package can be installed from CRAN or GitHub (see the package's
[README](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/stplanr) for details),
it can be loaded in with `library()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stplanr") # stable CRAN version
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr") # dev version
```

```{r}
library(stplanr) # also loads spatial package
```


> - Dev version requires rtools on Windows

## Why host on ROpenSci?

- Assisted with documentation: [ropensci/stplanr/commits?author=karthik](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/commits?author=karthik)
- Set-up Continuous Integration (CI): https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/stplanr

![](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/stplanr.svg?branch=master)

- Provided peer review of the code: https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/10

## Example of benefits of peer review

> Use `@importFrom` whenever possible. Right now you have `import(openxlsx)` and `import(sp)` in your NAMESPACE file. Just import the functions you need. Same for other pkg deps. 

> Tests: Pleae write tests to cover at least all the major functions before we accept. Use `testthat::skip_on_cran()` for any tests that do web requests, so that CRAN tests don't fail in case a service is temporarily down

## Addition of better API key handling

> I think token's can be a bit easier for the user. Right now you have e.g.,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!Sys.getenv('CYCLESTREET') == "") {
    cckey <- Sys.getenv('CYCLESTREET')
}
if(is.null(cckey)){
    stop("You must have a CycleStreets.net api key saved as 'cckey'")
}
```

## Importance of documentation: test datasets

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d = read.csv(text = "
cents,            SpatialPointsDataFrame of home locations for flow analysis.
destination_zones,example destinations data
destinations,     example destinations data
flow,             data frame of commuter flows
flow_dests,       data frame of invented commuter flows with destinations in a different layer than the origins
flowlines,        SpatialLinesDataFrame of commuter flows
routes_fast,      SpatialLinesDataFrame of commuter flows on the travel network
routes_slow,      SpatialLinesDataFrame of commuter flows on the travel network
zones,            SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of home locations for flow analysis.
           ")
knitr::kable(d)
```
## Example data: 'Flow' or OD data

```{r}
data("flow", package = "stplanr")
head(flow[c(1:3, 12)])
```

## Centroids data

```{r}
data("cents", package = "stplanr")
as.data.frame(cents[1:3,-c(3,4)])
```

## Creating a single desire line

```{r}
flow_single_line = flow[4,] # select only the first line
desire_line_single = od2line(flow = flow_single_line, zones = cents)
plot(cents)
plot(desire_line_single, add = T)
```

## What just happened?

- We selected a single 'od-pair' (`flow[4,]`)
- The function `od2line()` matched the cents matching the lines and created a line (the hard bit)
- How? Check the source code!

```{r}
od2line
```

## A hard-coded version:

```{r}
o = cents[cents$geo_code %in% flow$Area.of.residence[4],]
d = cents[cents$geo_code %in% flow$Area.of.workplace[4],]
l_single = Lines(list(Line(rbind(o@coords, d@coords))), ID = 1)
l_sp = SpatialLines(LinesList = list(l_single))
```

## Visualising the result

```{r}
plot(cents)
points(o, cex = 5)
points(d, cex = 5)
flow[4, 1:3]
plot(l_sp, add = TRUE)
```

## Creating 'desire lines' for all flows

```{r, warning=FALSE}
l <- od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
# remove lines with no length
l <- l[!l$Area.of.residence == l$Area.of.workplace,]
plot(l, lwd = l$All / 10)
```

## Allocating flows to the transport network

**stplanr** has various functions for route allocation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
route_cyclestreet() # UK, cycling
route_graphhopper() # worldwide, any mode
route_transportapi_public() # UK, public transport
viaroute() # worldwide, any mode
```

## Test

```{r, echo=FALSE}
r = route_cyclestreet(from = "London", to = "Leeds, UK")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# saveRDS(r, "data/leeds-to-poz.Rds")
r = readRDS("data/leeds-to-poz.Rds")
```

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addPolylines(data = r)
```

## Routing many lines

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes_fast = line2route(l = l)
```

```{r}
plot(l)
plot(routes_fast, add = T, col = "red")
```

# Future plans

## Routing functions

- Add more services (e.g. OpenTripPlanner)
- Integrate interface
- Add support for OSM data download and analysis
- Via interface to **[osmdatar](https://github.com/osmdatar/osmdatar)**

## Applications

- Work with practitioners to make it more useful for them (e.g. ITP)
- Link with industry (e.g. ITP)
- Make more international 
- A global propensity to cycle tool?
- Better handling of GPS data

## Links and getting involved

- Download and test the dev version with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr")
```

- Create issues on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues)
- Check out the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/introducing-stplanr.html)
- See my tutorial on visualising spatial data for eRum: [Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/vignettes/vspd-base-shiny.md](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/vignettes/vspd-base-shiny.md)
- Academic paper on the PCT: http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04425

## Exercises

- Work through the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/introducing-stplanr.html) provided by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("introducing-stplanr")
```

- Create a single desire line for the 12th flow without using **stplanr** code (**stplanr** solution below):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
od2line(flow = flow[12,], zones = cents)
```

- Visualise the `flowlines` object using **tmap** with different colours and widths
- Create a 'oneway' version of the `flowlines` and visualise these (tricky)
- Create a **sf** version of the `flowlines` object (advanced)

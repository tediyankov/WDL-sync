'Reverse clipping' in R
========================================================

A reverse clip saves only the part of your spatial object that is *outside*
the bounds of another object, as opposed to a regular clip which saves the
parts that are *inside* the other object.

```{r}
# simplify UK geometry 1st
ukborder <- readOGR("/scratch/data/boundaries/uk-outline/", "infuse_uk_2011")
library(rgeos)
ukG <- gSimplify(ukborder, tol = 1000)
object.size(ukG) / 1000000
plot(ukG)
ukG <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(ukG, data.frame(zone = 1), match.ID = F)
writeOGR(ukG, "/home/georl/repos/Creating-maps-in-R/data/", "ukbord", "ESRI Shapefile")
```


Let's load some data to see it in operation:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

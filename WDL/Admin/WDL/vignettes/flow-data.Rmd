We can explore flow data with the 
**stplanr** package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/stplanr")
```

```{r}
library(stplanr)
```

This is what flow data looks like:

```{r}
data("flow")
head(flow[1:3])
```

This is what centroid data looks like

```{r}
data("cents")
head(coordinates(cents))
plot(cents)
```

You need to allocated the flows to the
centroids to visualise the flows:

```{r}
l <- gFlow2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
plot(l)
```

Now we can allocate the flows to the 
travel network:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
bbox(l)
cyclep <- gLines2CyclePath(l, plan = "fastest")
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addPolylines(data = l) %>% 
  addPolylines(data = cyclep, color = "red")
```


```{r}
example(gOverline)
```

Use development versions of osmdata and stplanr packages plus a few others:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/osmdata")
```

```{r}
library(stplanr)
library(osmdata)
library(tmap)
```


Ensure you have a valid routing API key (e.g. Graphhoper - apply online).

Identify the origins and destinations.

For distance-to-border calculations the destination would be the nearest point on the border, or location over the border.

An illustrative example is shown below:

```{r}
(o = geo_code("Dublin"))
(d = geo_code("Belfast"))
```

For each OD pair, find the route between them:

```{r}
r = route_graphhopper(from = o, to = d, vehicle = "car")
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(r)
```

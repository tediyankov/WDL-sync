Naming conventions in R are famously anarchic, with no clear winner and multiple
conventions in use *simultaneously* in the same package. This has been written
about before, in a lucid article in the
[R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf), a detailed exploration of
names in R source code [hosted on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rockchalk/vignettes/Rstyle.pdf)
and general discussion on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944910/what-is-your-preferred-style-for-naming-variables-in-r).

Basically, there are 5 naming conventions to choose from:

* alllowercase: e.g. `adjustcolor`
* period.separated: e.g. `plot.new`
* underscore_separated: e.g. `numeric_version`
* lowerCamelCase: e.g. `addTaskCallback`
* UpperCamelCase: e.g. `SignatureMethod`

There are clear advantages to choosing one naming convention
and sticking to it, regardless which one it is:

> "Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT" 

The
[Google Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml) is ironically written in a rather inconsistent
way (mixing capitals with lowercase in a single sentence
surely breaks their own rule!)

But which one to choose?

## Naming convention chaos

I recently encountered this question when I looked at the CRAN
hosted version of the tutorial
I co-authored 'Introduction to visualising spatial data in R'.
To my dismay, this document was littered with inconsistencies: here are
just a few of the object names used, breaking almost every naming convention:

- `Partic_Per`: This variable is trying to be simultaneously UpperCamelBack and
underscore_separated: a new naming convention I'd like to coin Upper_Underscore_Separated (joke). Here's another example: `Spatial_DistrictName` These styles should not be mixed according to
[Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
and [Colin Gillespie](http://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/r-style-guide/).
- `sport.wgs84`: An example of period.separation
- `crimeDat$MajorText`: lowerCamelBack and UpperCamelBack *in the same object*!
- `ons_label`: a rare example of a consistent use of a naming convention, although
this was in a variable name, not an object.

Does any of your code look like this? If so I suggest sorting it out.
Ironically, we had a section on typographic conventions *in the error strewn
document*. This states that:

> "it is a good idea
> to get into the habit of consistent and clear writing in any language, and R is no
> exception".

It was time to follow our own advice!

## A trigger to remedy chaotic code

The tutorial was used as the basis for a [workshop](http://foss4g-e.org/content/using-r-command-line-gis) delivered at the Free and Open Source Software for Geo-spatial
([FOSS4G](http://foss4g.org/)) conference in [Bremen](http://foss4g-e.org/).
The event is affiliated with the The Open Source Geospatial Foundation
([OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/)), who are big advocates of consistency and
[standards](http://live.osgeo.org/en/standards/standards.html). With
many experienced programmers at the event, it was the
perfect opportunity to update the tutorial on the project's
[github repository](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R).

## Which naming convention?

We decided to use the **underscore_separated** naming convention.
Why? It wasn't because we love typing underscores (which
can cause problems in some contexts), but because of more fundamental
issues with the other options:

- alllowercase names are difficult to read, especially for non-native readers.
- period.separated names are confusing for users of
[Python](http://python4astronomers.github.io/python/objects.html) and other
languages in which dots are meaningful.
- UpperCamelBack is *ugly* and requires excessive use of the shift button.

There are also a couple of reasons why we positively like underscores:

- Underscores are **fast** to read: 10% to 20% faster than camelBack, which
is especially confusing to non-native English readers, according to
[one article](http://whathecode.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/camelcase-vs-underscores-scientific-showdown/).
- Underscores are recommended by some prominent R users,
including [Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html),
[Colin Gillespie](http://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/r-style-guide/)
and [Andrew Gellman](http://andrewgelman.com/2012/08/28/migrating-from-dot-to-underscore/).

## Implementing a consistent coding convention

After overcoming the mental inertia to decide on a new naming
convention, actually implementing it should be the easy part.
A series of [regex](http://robinlovelace.net/r/2014/04/14/regex-in-R-RStudio.html)
commands could help, including the following
(the 'Regex' tickbox must be enabled if you're searching in RStudio):

```
[a-z]\.[a-z] # will search for dots between lowercase chars (period.separation)
[a-z][A-Z] # find camelBack code
```

Unfortunately, these commands will also find many R commands that use
these naming convention, so just re-reading the code may be just as fast.

The below image shows the github diff of a typical change
as part of a renaming strategy. Note in this example that
not only are we implementing a consistent naming convention, we
also added a new comment in this commit, improving the code's 'understandability'.
Implementing a naming convention can be part of a wider campaign to improve
your R projects. This could include adding comments,
[removing redundant information](http://robinlovelace.net/r/2014/06/25/pruning-a-giant-gh-repo.html) from large projects and
reformatting code, perhaps using the [formatR package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/formatR/index.html).

## Conclusion

It *is* important to think about style in writing any languages,
especially if your code will be
[read by others](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf):

> "What could help might be to raise awareness in the R community about naming
> conventions; writers of books and tutorials on R could make a
> difference here by treating naming conventions when introducing
> the R language."

In conclusion, it is lazy and irresponsible to write and maintain messy code that
is difficult to read. 
By contrast, consistent, clear and well-commented code will help you
and others use your code and ensure its longevity.
Adoption of a clearly defined [naming convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_%28programming%29)
such as the **underscore_separation** adopted in our
[tutorial](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/raw/master/intro-spatial-rl.pdf) can be an easy step one can take *now* towards this aim.

The only question that remains is which naming convention `WiLL.U_uSe`!

```{r, eval=F, echo=FALSE}
ls("vignettes/updating-style.md")
system("mv vignettes/updating-style.md ~/repos/robinlovelace.github.io/_posts/2014-07-15-naming-conventions-r.md")
```
